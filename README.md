##My shorthand and cheetsheets

Through my data analytics learning i've been shorthand pretty much everything i should remember, and alot of code cheetsheets such as:

- CLI command
- sql commands
- data analyse definition
- python cheetsheet
- pandas cheetsheet
- numpy cheetsheet
- visualizing cheetsheet
- python : list, string, dictionary cheetsheet
- and english words that i have to learn translate to persian

I hope they might come handy ;)
