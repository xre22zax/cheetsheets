ex (left join 3 table with user id and select columns we need, build a funnel):
WITH funnels AS (				**create a table**
  SELECT 
     DISTINCT b.browse_date,
     b.user_id,
     c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout',

  LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
    ON p.user_id = c.user_id)
SELECT browse_date,				**select wanted column**
   COUNT(*) AS 'num_browse',
   SUM(is_checkout) AS 'num_checkout',		**calculate things we want and create a colunm**
   SUM(is_purchase) AS 'num_purchase',
   1.0 * SUM(is_checkout) / COUNT(user_id) AS 'browse_to_checkout',
   1.0 * SUM(is_purchase) / SUM(is_checkout) AS 'checkout_to_purchase'
FROM funnels

27. SELECT * FROM table1
		UNION				**put data togather & whitch on top columns should be same**
	SELECT * FROM table2;



28. WITH defaultname AS)			**with id use to write any temprory table we want**
		SELECT ....

29. Window Function Syntax

SELECT 
   month,
   SUM(change_in_followers) OVER (		**Over is where function began**
      ORDER BY month
   ) AS 'running_total'
FROM
   social_media
WHERE
   username = 'instagram';



30. PARTITION BY

SELECT 
    username,
    AVG(change_in_followers) OVER (
      PARTITION BY username 			**PARTITION BY allows you to see all of the resultant rows**
      ORDER BY month
    ) 'running_avg_followers_change'
FROM
    social_media;


31. FIRST_VALUE() or LAST_VALUE()

SELECT
   username,
   posts,
   FIRST_VALUE (posts) OVER (
      PARTITION BY username 
      ORDER BY posts
   ) fewest_posts
FROM
   social_media;

SELECT
   username,
   posts,
   LAST_VALUE (posts) OVER (
      PARTITION BY username 
      ORDER BY posts
      RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 	**to show us the most posts for a user, we need to specify a frame for our window function.**
      UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) most_posts
FROM
    social_media;


32. LAG - specified offset which comes before (LAG) or after (LEAD) the current row.

SELECT
   artist,
   week,
   streams_millions,
   streams_millions - 
   LAG(streams_millions, 1, 0) OVER (			**get 3 value: column, offset, replace null**
      ORDER BY week 
   ) previous_week_streams 
FROM
   streams 						**this code gets the before stream and minus the current one **


33. LEAD

SELECT
   artist,
   week,
   streams_millions,
   LEAD(streams_millions, 1) OVER (
      PARTITION BY artist
      ORDER BY week
   ) - streams_millions AS 'streams_millions_change'
FROM
   streams;


34.ROW_NUMBER : adds a sequential integer number to each row

SELECT 
   ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      ORDER BY streams_millions DESC 
   ) AS 'row_num', 
   artist, 
   week,
   streams_millions
FROM
   streams;


35. RANK : when two values are the same, they will have the same rank whereas with ROW_NUMBER they would not.

SELECT 
   RANK() OVER (
      ORDER BY streams_millions
   ) AS 'rank', 
   artist, 
   week,
   streams_millions
FROM
   streams;


36. NTILE : break your data into roughly equal groups

SELECT 
   NTILE(5) OVER (
      ORDER BY streams_millions DESC
   ) AS 'weekly_streams_group', 
   artist, 
   week,
   streams_millions
FROM
   streams;


37. ABS() function returns the absolute value of the input expression.

SELECT ABS(-3); -- 3


38. CAST() function is used to convert the value of an expression into another data type.

SELECT CAST('3.14 is pi' AS REAL) / 2;


39. Date and Time Functions

SELECT DATETIME('now', 'localtime');
SELECT DATETIME('2020-09-01 17:38:22');
SELECT DATETIME('2020-02-10', 'start of month', '-1 day', '+7 hours');



40. STRFTIME()

SELECT STRFTIME('%d', order_date) AS 'order_day',
  COUNT(*) 
FROM bakery
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


41. Compare Funnels For A/B testing

ex:
SELECT modal_text,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'control' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'control_clicks',
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'variant' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'variant_clicks'
FROM onboarding_modals
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
