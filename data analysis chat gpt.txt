# EDA analysis

1. provide me the descriptive statistics for information in this field and comments on these descriptive statics
	(search every column and give mean,count,etc )

2. invastigate outliers in sheet (maybe make some graphs)

3.perform correlation analysis on sheets and formulate hypothesis, suggest further data analysis that could cariied out with this data
	(intericate relationships between variables and connections)

## 5w & 1h framework
- what is the task
- where?
- why? analysis aim to provide initial understandinf and preliminary insights from dataset
- whitch are the details we want ai focos on 
- who?
- how we want ai to conduct the analysis? 

4. conduct a comperhensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ........ Dataset. 
   Highlight any territorial trends or patterns evident in the dataset. 
   The intention behind this analysis is to delve deeper into the dataset,revealing its potential for future detailed examinations.
   while analyzing, be on the lookout for any dataset inconsistencies or peculiarities ans approach the task with rigor and scrutiny of a seasoned data analysis.
   for a holistic understandinf, ensure to integrate information from sheets using ..... field as a connecting point.

# Preprossessing data - dealing with inconsitant data

1. in this file you will find column named "......", unify all enteries this column for following variables (...,...,...), correct and unify the diffrent ways in which these names written.

2. sense check the data in this file and try to see if there are any errors or inconsistencies
   'or' can you find inconsistencies between diffrent columns
	(check for diffrent type of inconsistencies such as date or city mistmatch and etc.)

   after youve created the list, populate it in new sheet names '....' on same spreadsheet.
	( yoou can sort diffrent entries of two or more columns)


# Preprocess data - working with functions

1. Help me analyze the data in provided excel, i need to calculate total sales per each country in new sheet.
   which are the excel formulas allow me to do that? suggest formulas that work for entire 'database' sheet.
   also, i need one formula that can be pasted in all cells of the table to be filed in that new sheet

   can you help me sort the entire table in ascendinf order according to the dates in the specific columns?
	(sort the dataset by exact date)


# practical example

1. can you suggest several preprocessing steps that would allow me to perform meaningful dat analysis with this file and extract relevent information from it?

2. i require your assistance in preprocessing dataset for subsequent analysis.
   I need you to perform this preprocessing exercise as a seasoned and very capable data analysis.
   Here's a breakdown of tasks i'd like you to perform:

   (1) Handle missing values:
	- drop the scr columns in '...' sheet
	- for '....' column, replace missing values with True
   (2) Feature engineering:
	- Calculate the duration (in days)between when a student joined the platform and their last login.
	   Store this in a new column named '...'
	- In this dataset, classify the country column by their respective continents
	   add this classification in a new column adjacent to 'country'
	- Extract the year, month and day of week from both the joined and last login columns
	   create a new columns for these extracted pieces of data

   (3) for all the columns such as ('...', '...', '...') with monetary data, devide the values by 100 to have them in dollar and cent format
